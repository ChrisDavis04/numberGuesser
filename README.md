# numberGuesser
Woaaahhhhh you (yes you, the person reading this) comes across a weird chest that asks you to guess a number...How exciting. You must guess the correct number within the allotted tries or something really bad happens. This is another project for my programming class and it was meant for practice with while loops, ranges, and if/elif statements.
